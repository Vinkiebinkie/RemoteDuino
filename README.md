# RemoteDuino

## Idea

RemoteDuino exists of a Arduino (Uno) and a Raspberry Pi 3 (model B+). The Arduino functions as a client with a serial connection to the Raspberry Pi, which functions as a server.
Commands can be send from the server to the client to retrieve sensor data, switch outputs etc. etc. anything that can be connected to the Arduino really. 

The communication between server and client is wireless, in my case with HC-12 transceivers, these are easy to use wireless serial port modules.
